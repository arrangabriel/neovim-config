# Neovim config

This is my personal configuration for a nice Neovim experience. Includes a file browser, lsp-setup, fuzzy finder, visual flair and more.

## Dependencies

- Neovim version>0.9
- A patched [nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)

## Setup

1. Clone into `$HOME/.config/nvim`
2. Enjoy
